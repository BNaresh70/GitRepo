GIT Configuration
==================
Once GIT Installation done in our System,

-> The first thing we need to do is set our username and the email address.

-> This is because when we use git to change the files in the project.
Git uses this information to identify who has made the changes to the file.

-> The command to add the username and address is Git Config.

Git uses a Series of configuration files to determine the Behaviour.
Git has multiple levels of Configuration:
=========================================
	
---> System Level (Git Installation)
	This is the highest level of config and applies to all Users on the system.

System Level Configuration Location:
   /usr/local/etc/gitconfig ---- (Linux)
   C:\ProgramFiles\Git\Config ---- (Windows)

---> Global Level (User Account)
	This level applies to the current user only.

Global Level Configuration Location:
 ~/.gitconfig -----(Linux)
 C:\Users\<username>\.gitconfig --- (Windows)

---> Local Level (Repository/Project Level)
   This level applies to a specific repository only.
Local Level Configuration Location:
 .git/config --- (Windows)



NOTE: The heirarchy of identify the username and email has follows,
      Git identifies the username and email first local level if exits it will take,
      If not then check at Global level, If it is not there finally it checks at System        Level.[D[D[D[D[3~[3~[3~[3~[3~[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C
